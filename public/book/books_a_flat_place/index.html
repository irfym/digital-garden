  Summary
  <a class="anchor" href="#summary">#</a>
</h2>
<p>There are many things that I could say about this book, many of them perhaps not suitable to be published to the internet. I don&rsquo;t really how to feel after reading this, but this is the only recent book in memory that has stirred up such strong emotions, and resonant emotions that I recognise intimately.</p>
<p>In each chapter Masud ties a geographical flat place with a thematic reflection upon her upbringing. Her exploration of each flat place is tied into an exploration of what she terms &lsquo;complex trauma&rsquo;, otherwise also known (in the NHS at least) as 
  <a href="https://www.nhs.uk/mental-health/conditions/post-traumatic-stress-disorder-ptsd/complex/">complex PTSD</a>. As something distinct from PTSD, it&rsquo;s certainly something that I did not know existed, but its causes and effects are shown with raw honesty in her book.</p>
<p>Her first flat place is (was?) in Lahore - a landscape of pure fields, in which she seemingly alone takes joy in during car rides, crushed into the too-small family car with her parents and siblings. It forms an escape for her, as a landscape and a space that alone has the power to absord and accept her. I came into this book with lighthearted expectations, but this quickly faded during the first few pages of the book. Her relationship with her father comes to dominate her life, and is constantly returned to throughout the book. Although not much is said at first, you can quickly grasp the troubling nature of this relationship and its effects.</p>
<p>The subsequent chapters cover Ely, Orford Ness, Morecambe Bay, Newcastle Moor, Orkney, and finally a virtual return to Pakistan. With each location Masud brings to light the hidden histories and realities of each place. With a few places, its the golliwog dolls on display. In Ely, its the transformation of the rich fens and marshland into agricultural land, for better or for worse - man&rsquo;s impact and dominance on nature. In Orford Ness, it was the role of 
  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_Labour_Corps">Chinese labour</a>. In Morecambe Bay, more forced labour is explored. In Newcastle Moor, the hypocrisies of Covid, and the hidden histories of the Moor are described (human zoos! Not too long ago&hellip;). I especially liked her reflections on the democratisation of public spaces - when is a space useful, or not? What makes it so? And to whom? In each chapter, conflicts are touched upon - conflicts of our present society, and conflicts that are a direct result of Britain&rsquo;s colonial past. And with each chapter we delve deeper into the history of her birthplace, her Pakistan - and I say &lsquo;her&rsquo; Pakistan because it is so markedly different to others.</p>
<h2 id="how-did-it-make-me-feel">
  How did it make me feel
  <a class="anchor" href="#how-did-it-make-me-feel">#</a>
</h2>
<p>I don&rsquo;t want to make light of the complex PTSD, nor do I want to imply that I suffer forms of complex trauma. But I think I can honestly relate to some of what she describes. Especially her emotional &lsquo;flatness&rsquo;, and her struggles to connect to other people, and how specifically how this is a result of emotional connections (or lack thereof) and conditions experienced during childhood. In particular, I could empathise with many of her experiences during Covid. Her writing and reflections have made me question a lot of what I consider normal.</p>
<p>Regardless of how well her feelings are reflected in mine, she brings you into her headspace with such intensity and vividness, that you can almost feel her physical and visceral reactions. I think that&rsquo;s part of what makes this book so impactful.</p>
<p>As a muslim, undoubtedly there was sorrow (even tinged with disappointment?) where she talks about her loss of her faith. At the same time, can I blame her? When she grew up as she did, and when her father created the environment that he did?</p>
<p>She brings to light the injustices in everyday society, the prejudices that many of us experience on a societal and a personal level. Many of these have gone unnoticed to me. Is this a good or a bad thing? Should I be aware of them, so that I can advocate for justice for others? Or should I be ignoring them, leading a life of contentedness ignoring these tests? Again, this makes me question my perception of normal.</p>
<p>One other thing - the book inspired me to look more carefully into nature, and make an attempt to learn about the history of places, as well as the specific flora and fauna in each location. Starting with something as small as learning the names of common plants and trees.</p>
<h2 id="trauma-and-faith">
  Trauma and faith
  <a class="anchor" href="#trauma-and-faith">#</a>
</h2>
<p>I know that faith is not a main focus of Masud&rsquo;s writing, and certainly her description of her father doesn&rsquo;t inspire faith. His self-description as a &lsquo;sufi&rsquo; alongside his episodes of creating alcohol, smuggling drugs, and imprisonment of his family, are certainly not actions of the faithful.</p>
<p>However, I do want to look into this further, and look at the relationship between faith and trauma, not just from an Islamic lens, but other spiritual lenses as well. There are couple resources that I&rsquo;m noting there to revisit later on.</p>
