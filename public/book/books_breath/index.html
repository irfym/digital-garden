The actual practical manual section is still included though, and is neatly summarised in the back of the book with a link to all the exercises online at 
  his website.">

  <a href="https://app.thestorygraph.com/books/b4a34771-12f7-4e86-8244-1b90be91947f">here</a>, and written by James Nestor.</p>

<p>Summary of the main points as I understood them:</p>
<ul>
<li>Mouth breathing is bad. It can lead to all kinds of health conditions, sleep apnea, collapsed throat muscles, and more. The nose has a function of warming up and humidifying the air before entry into the body. Ancient texts have historically recognised the need for nose breathing.</li>
<li>The apparently &lsquo;perfect&rsquo; breath consists of 5.5 seconds of inhaling, followed 5.5 seconds of exhaling. This was purported to be found in again, many ancient texts, and religious traditions. He includes Islam in this, but I&rsquo;m not convinced - but perhaps I haven&rsquo;t come across it yet.</li>
<li>Breathing through each of our nostrils actually has different effects on our body, activating different parts of the brain. There are multiple exercise forcing inhalation and exhalation through one nostril at a time.</li>
<li>Improving our breathing technique can significantly improve our athletic performance and lower our resting breathing rate. We can train this, in the same way that free-divers can train their breath holding capabilities.</li>
<li>Forced, slower breathing can have beneficial effects. Increased carbon dioxide content in our breath can have beneficial effects.</li>
<li>Chewing is important. The shift to softer, more processed foods has in part lead to underdeveloped jaws, smaller mouths, and multiple dental conditions. Orthodontist practices of removing teeth could be making this worse, where the aim is aesthetics. We should be working hard to chew our food.</li>
<li>There are a bunch of breathing practices out there which can defy our normal expectations. I need to do more research into this. Some if it Nestor mentioned could be putting us in danger if not practised correctly.</li>
</ul>
<p>All in all, a nice and definitely interesting book to read. I&rsquo;ve already picked up some of the practices that he has mentioned, but I think still too early to see if there has been an effect.</p>
