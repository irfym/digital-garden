[{"id":0,"href":"/book/books_a_flat_place/","title":"A Flat Place","section":"Books","content":"Read in July 2024. Storygraph link here, and written by Noreen Masud. I got this as part of the non-fiction book subscription from Libreria.\nSummary # There are many things that I could say about this book, many of them perhaps not suitable to be published to the internet. I don\u0026rsquo;t really how to feel after reading this, but this is the only recent book in memory that has stirred up such strong emotions, and resonant emotions that I recognise intimately.\nIn each chapter Masud ties a geographical flat place with a thematic reflection upon her upbringing. Her exploration of each flat place is tied into an exploration of what she terms \u0026lsquo;complex trauma\u0026rsquo;, otherwise also known (in the NHS at least) as complex PTSD. As something distinct from PTSD, it\u0026rsquo;s certainly something that I did not know existed, but its causes and effects are shown with raw honesty in her book.\nHer first flat place is (was?) in Lahore - a landscape of pure fields, in which she seemingly alone takes joy in during car rides, crushed into the too-small family car with her parents and siblings. It forms an escape for her, as a landscape and a space that alone has the power to absord and accept her. I came into this book with lighthearted expectations, but this quickly faded during the first few pages of the book. Her relationship with her father comes to dominate her life, and is constantly returned to throughout the book. Although not much is said at first, you can quickly grasp the troubling nature of this relationship and its effects.\nThe subsequent chapters cover Ely, Orford Ness, Morecambe Bay, Newcastle Moor, Orkney, and finally a virtual return to Pakistan. With each location Masud brings to light the hidden histories and realities of each place. With a few places, its the golliwog dolls on display. In Ely, its the transformation of the rich fens and marshland into agricultural land, for better or for worse - man\u0026rsquo;s impact and dominance on nature. In Orford Ness, it was the role of Chinese labour. In Morecambe Bay, more forced labour is explored. In Newcastle Moor, the hypocrisies of Covid, and the hidden histories of the Moor are described (human zoos! Not too long ago\u0026hellip;). I especially liked her reflections on the democratisation of public spaces - when is a space useful, or not? What makes it so? And to whom? In each chapter, conflicts are touched upon - conflicts of our present society, and conflicts that are a direct result of Britain\u0026rsquo;s colonial past. And with each chapter we delve deeper into the history of her birthplace, her Pakistan - and I say \u0026lsquo;her\u0026rsquo; Pakistan because it is so markedly different to others.\nHow did it make me feel # I don\u0026rsquo;t want to make light of the complex PTSD, nor do I want to imply that I suffer forms of complex trauma. But I think I can honestly relate to some of what she describes. Especially her emotional \u0026lsquo;flatness\u0026rsquo;, and her struggles to connect to other people, and how specifically how this is a result of emotional connections (or lack thereof) and conditions experienced during childhood. In particular, I could empathise with many of her experiences during Covid. Her writing and reflections have made me question a lot of what I consider normal.\nRegardless of how well her feelings are reflected in mine, she brings you into her headspace with such intensity and vividness, that you can almost feel her physical and visceral reactions. I think that\u0026rsquo;s part of what makes this book so impactful.\nAs a muslim, undoubtedly there was sorrow (even tinged with disappointment?) where she talks about her loss of her faith. At the same time, can I blame her? When she grew up as she did, and when her father created the environment that he did?\nShe brings to light the injustices in everyday society, the prejudices that many of us experience on a societal and a personal level. Many of these have gone unnoticed to me. Is this a good or a bad thing? Should I be aware of them, so that I can advocate for justice for others? Or should I be ignoring them, leading a life of contentedness ignoring these tests? Again, this makes me question my perception of normal.\nOne other thing - the book inspired me to look more carefully into nature, and make an attempt to learn about the history of places, as well as the specific flora and fauna in each location. Starting with something as small as learning the names of common plants and trees.\nTrauma and faith # I know that faith is not a main focus of Masud\u0026rsquo;s writing, and certainly her description of her father doesn\u0026rsquo;t inspire faith. His self-description as a \u0026lsquo;sufi\u0026rsquo; alongside his episodes of creating alcohol, smuggling drugs, and imprisonment of his family, are certainly not actions of the faithful.\nHowever, I do want to look into this further, and look at the relationship between faith and trauma, not just from an Islamic lens, but other spiritual lenses as well. There are couple resources that I\u0026rsquo;m noting there to revisit later on.\nYaqeen Institute\u0026rsquo;s series on trauma Faith to move mountains, Bryant-Davis \u0026amp; Wong (2013) Psychological Trauma, Wilson \u0026amp; Moran (1998) "},{"id":1,"href":"/arabic/arabic-grammar-yr1/","title":"Arabic grammar, year 1","section":"Arabics","content":"This is a summary of the basic grammatical concepts covered in year 1 of my studies. The curriculum loosely followed Haywood and Nahmad\u0026rsquo;s structure, for the first 11 or so chapters.\nDefinite and indefinite # ال is used to indicate the definite article in arabic. In adding the ال you drop the tanwin that you normally have at the end of an indefinite word. You can\u0026rsquo;t have them both together! Whether or not you pronounce the ل, or you join straight onto the the next letter with a shaddah depends on whether the first letter of the word is a sun or a moon letter. Nouns and noun sentences # When using adjectives to describe nouns, they have to agree on the following four elements: Definition Gender Case ending Numbers To create a complete sentence, you need something that contains complete information, and not just a fragment. [D + I = NS] Putting a definite and indefinite word together forms a complete sentence. For example: القمرُ جَميلٌ - The moon is beautiful\nQuestions can be asked by constructing the sentence in the usual way, and then placing either a هَلْ or a أ at the start of the sentence. Where the alif joins another alif, you should elide the first alif, e.g. آلقمر جميل؟. When the ل of the هَلْ joins onto ال, the first lam should take a kasrah to allow joining, e.g. هَلِ الْولد جديد.\nThere are three kinds of اسم:\nاسم جامد - these are isms which are not derived from anything, and nothing is derived from it, e.g., رَجُلٌ. اسم مصدر - these are isms which are not derived, but words can be derived from it, e.g., نَصْرٌ. اسم مشتق - these are both derived, and other words can be derived from it, e.g., عالم. Masculine and feminine # Words, اسم are split into masculine and feminine. There are three kinds of feminine words: Biologically feminine. These are words like mother, daughter, bride, etc. Feminine by design. These are words that you can make feminine, typically by adding the ta marbuta (ة). This applies mostly to adjectives, and you cannot do this to nouns - they are already inherently feminine or masculine. If there is a ة at the end of the word, you can assume 99% of the time that it is feminine. Feminine by convention. These applies to categories of words, like: Geographical names Body parts in pairs. Feminine for no apparent reason. These are ones you have to learn. Examples are شمس, ارض, نفس. Remember that the gender of the adjective has to follow the gender of the noun. Case endings # A word will have a fixed spelling, but its case ending (the vowel on the last letter) will not be fixed. This varies depending on the case of the word, and is called اِعْراب. There are three possible states for case endings: رَفْعٌ - also called the nominative state. Ending is -ُ or -ٌ نَصْبٌ - also called the accusative state. Ending is -َ or -ً جَرٌّ - also called the genitive state. Ending is -ِ or -ٍ Certain case endings are caused, and others are \u0026lsquo;default\u0026rsquo;. There are over 100 causative agents, and they all have subcategories. As an example, 17 of these agents are prepositions. Prepositions always render the following word in the j-state. For example: مِنَ البَيتِ القديمِ - from the small house\nPossession # This is known as إِضافة. There are several rules for possession: No ال on the first word. No tanwin on the first word. Kasrah on the second word (the possessor), which is the جر state. Examples are: بَيتُ الرَّخُلِ- The man\u0026rsquo;s house.\nنُورُ اللّه- The light of Allah.\nWhen adding another adjective onto the possessor, or the possessed, you need to make sure you agree with the definite/indefinite article, and the case ending. كتابُ الطالبِ الجديدِ - The new student\u0026rsquo;s book.\nكتابُ الطالبِ الجديدُ - The student\u0026rsquo;s new book.\nDespite not having a alif lam on it, the \u0026lsquo;book\u0026rsquo; above is definite, as it is known. For indefinite words, you would use -ٍ كتابُ طالبٍ - A student\u0026rsquo;s book.\nNames of places and foreign places have different case endings due to being diptotes. This means they don\u0026rsquo;t take -ِ or -ً فِ مكةَ - In Makkah\nIdhafa constructs can also be used to limit or define the application of something. هو قليل العقل - He is of little intellect.\nPlurals # Arabic plurals can take masculine or feminine, dual or plural (3+) form, and can either be broken or sound plurals. Sound plurals are typically used for adjectives, and differ between the masculine and the feminine. Their form is as follows: Masculine Feminine Single مُسْلِمٌ مُسْلِمَةٌ Dual R-state مسلمانِ مُسْلِمتانِ N/J-state مسلمَيْنِ مسلمتَيْنِ Plural R-state مسلمُونَ مسلماتٌ N/J-state مسلمِيْنَ مسلماتٍ However, most nouns will take a broken plural form, and some adjectives too. These broken plurals can appear in several different \u0026lsquo;scales\u0026rsquo;, however in practice it is probably easier just to memorise plurals along with their singular forms. Broken plurals can either be diptotes or triptotes - there is more information in Chapter 7 of Haywood and Nahmad. Broken plurals can be taken as feminine singular for the purposes of agreement. Therefore singular feminine adjectives and verbs can be used with broken masculine plurals. The exception to this is when describing male human beings, where you would use broken masculine plurals as usual (unless there\u0026rsquo;s a sound plural alternative). When you place duals in an idhafa construct, the ن at the end is dropped, e.g., كتابا الرجل (the two books of the man). Verb sentences # These follow the V-S-O format, for verb, subject, object. The subject will be in r-state, and the object is in the n-state. Sometimes the order differs, and the object may precede the verb, or the subject may precede the object. When you have explicitly specified the subject in the sentence (i.e. not used an attached pronoun), there is no need to agree the number with the subject, but you do have to agree the gender. Attached pronouns # ضَمِير - pronoun\nضَمائِر - pronouns\nPronouns can attach to three things:\nاسم فاعل حرف When attaching to an اسم, the relationship is of اضافة, e.g. كتبُكَ فالمدرسةِ (your book is in the madrasah). Pronouns are generally not declinable (i.e. مبني), except when for third-person pronouns preceded by a ي or a kasrah:\nكتابِهِ كتابِهِما كتابِهِمْ كتابِها كتابهِما كتابهِنَّ Note the small exception on the feminine singular.\nWhen attaching to a فاعل we can have both the attached object and the attached subject pronoun. One particular consideration here is when adding the attached object pronoun for انا.\nYou must place a nun wiqayah in front of the actual attached object pronoun, ي, e.g., ضربنى.\nWhen attaching to a حرف, the only type of harf that is important when adding a pronoun is the حرف جر, i.e., the preposition. This is split between the prepositions that end in a ي and those that don\u0026rsquo;t.\nFor the prepositions that don\u0026rsquo;t end in a ى, it is quite simple, you add the ضمير as usual without any further modification.\nFor those that end in a ي, you do a similar thing to the اسم above. The third person pronouns take a kasrah where possible, and for the first person, it\u0026rsquo;s فِيَّ and not فِيِّ, as the former is easier to pronounce.\nDemonstrative pronouns # These are known as اسم اِشارَة, nouns that point to something else.\nThese can be used in four ways, summarised below.\nهذا بيت - This is a house. هذا البيت - This house. هذا هو البيت - This is the house. بيت زيدٍ هذا - This house of Zayd. For \u0026rsquo;this\u0026rsquo; and \u0026rsquo;those\u0026rsquo;, see below:\nMasculine Feminine Single هذا هذه Dual R-state هذانِ هتانِ N/J-state هذينِ هتينِ Plural All states هؤُلاءِ هؤُلاءِ For \u0026rsquo;that\u0026rsquo; and \u0026rsquo;those\u0026rsquo; see below:\nMasculine Feminine Single ذالك ذاك تلك تاك تيك Dual R-state ذانِك تانِك N/J-state ذينك تينك Plural All states أُولاءِكَ أولالِكَ اُلاكَ Superlative, comparative and descriptives # All of these use the same scale: اَفْعَلُ, which is mapped to the descriptor. Superlative: Takes an idhafa construct. زيدٌ افْضَلُ الْقومِ - Zayd is the best of the people. The idhafa doesn\u0026rsquo;t depend on the gender of the person. Comparative: زيدٌ افضل من بكرٍ - Zayd is better than Bakr. Gender doesn\u0026rsquo;t matter. Descriptive: This does change by gender, as the scales differ. For masculine, the scale is اَفْعَلُ, and for feminine, the scale is فُعْلى. الرجل الأصغر - The smallest boy. البنت الصغرى - The smallest girl. Note then plurals will use the feminine singular, like you do for other adjectives. For colours, although they are on the same scale, they do not follow the same rules. It will probably just be easier for you to memorise them.

Moving from template 1 to 2, changes the meaning from intransitive to transitive (include the arabic for these terms when you get the chance). For example, نَزَلَ (he revealed), to نَزَّلَ (he sent it down), where an object is now needed.\nCommon verbs in template 2:\nعَلَّمَ - he taught يَسَّرَ - he made it easy حَوَّلَ - he converted (it) سَمَّيَ - he named (it) كَلَّمَ - he spoke to فَصَّلَ - he made it clear Template 3 # The extra letter here is an ا after the ف kalimah. Template 3 often involves a meaning change from template 1, where there is an exchange between two or more people. For example, قَرُبَ (he was near), to قَارَبَ (he came close, he came near).\nCommon verbs in template 3:\nقَارَبَ - he came close آخَذَ - he blamed/reproached تَابَعَ - he followed (each other) غَافَرَ - he forgave (mutually) نَادى - he summoned Template 4 # Template 4 is one of the most common templates found in the Qur\u0026rsquo;an.

It is also a template that contains a range of meaning patterns, whether they be transitive, intransitive, causative, stative, etc.\nTemplate 5 # This template, along with template 6, is known as the template of fathas, due to the vowelling of the active past, and both present forms. The extra letters are the ت before the ف kalimah, and the shaddah on the ع kalimah. This template is reflexive of template 2 (which is the intransitive version of template 1). Thus عَلَّمَ (he taught) becomes تَعَلَّمَ (he learned), i.e. to teach yourself.\nCommon verbs on template 2:\nتَعَلَّمَ - he learned تَوَلَّى - he took charge تَقَرَّبَ - he came close/approached Template 6 # Along with template 5, this is another باب of fathas.

The extra letters at the إِنْ before the ف kalimah.\nCommon verbs in template 7:\nإِنْفَطَرَ - he broke into tears Template 8 # The meaning pattern of this template is normally reflexive of template 1. For example, وَقَى (he saved) to إِتَّقََى (he was aware, he was on guard, protect one\u0026rsquo;s self). The extra letters here are the إِ before the ف kalimah and the ت after the ف kalimah.\nTemplate 9 # This template is typically only used for colours and physical disabilities. The extra letters are the إِ before the ف kalimah and the shaddah on the ل kalimah.\nExample verbs:\nاِحْمَرَّ - he turned red When conjugating this verb, you would open up the double letter (as it occurs at the end) - for example اِحْمَرَرْتُ. More technically, it\u0026rsquo;s only in the third person conjugations that rule 6 applies and the final two letters are doubled.\nTemplate 10 # This template is known for its است before the ف kalimah (which means to seek). It is reflexive of template 1 or 4, seeking the action of quality of the verb it is reflexive upon.

The book is less of a manual for breathing techniques, and more of a personal reflection and journey by Nestor as to how he tried overcoming his health problems and satiated his curiosity using the art of breathing. The actual practical manual section is still included though, and is neatly summarised in the back of the book with a link to all the exercises online at his website.\nSummary of the main points as I understood them:\nMouth breathing is bad. It can lead to all kinds of health conditions, sleep apnea, collapsed throat muscles, and more. The nose has a function of warming up and humidifying the air before entry into the body. Ancient texts have historically recognised the need for nose breathing. The apparently \u0026lsquo;perfect\u0026rsquo; breath consists of 5.5 seconds of inhaling, followed 5.5 seconds of exhaling. This was purported to be found in again, many ancient texts, and religious traditions. He includes Islam in this, but I\u0026rsquo;m not convinced - but perhaps I haven\u0026rsquo;t come across it yet. Breathing through each of our nostrils actually has different effects on our body, activating different parts of the brain. There are multiple exercise forcing inhalation and exhalation through one nostril at a time. Improving our breathing technique can significantly improve our athletic performance and lower our resting breathing rate. We can train this, in the same way that free-divers can train their breath holding capabilities. Forced, slower breathing can have beneficial effects. Increased carbon dioxide content in our breath can have beneficial effects. Chewing is important. The shift to softer, more processed foods has in part lead to underdeveloped jaws, smaller mouths, and multiple dental conditions. Orthodontist practices of removing teeth could be making this worse, where the aim is aesthetics. We should be working hard to chew our food. There are a bunch of breathing practices out there which can defy our normal expectations. I need to do more research into this. Some if it Nestor mentioned could be putting us in danger if not practised correctly. All in all, a nice and definitely interesting book to read. I\u0026rsquo;ve already picked up some of the practices that he has mentioned, but I think still too early to see if there has been an effect.\n"},{"id":8,"href":"/book/books_range/","title":"Range, Why Generalists Triumph in a Specialized World","section":"Books","content":"Some thoughts and lessons from the book Range: Why Generalists Triumph in a Specialized World, which I read in January 2021. The writing style was very engaging - you can see clearly where Epstein\u0026rsquo;s sports writing experience has come in here, and was highly enjoyable to read. Each chapter laid out a strong, clear concept, backed up by either research, anecdotes, biographies, or similar.\nI wanted to note down the key takeaways from the book, for future reference.\nThe cult of the head start # Tiger woods vs Roger Federer, the latter having a much more varied sports upbringing. But both achieved the top in their respective fields. However, the real world is not like sport. How the wicked world was made # Discussion on how the real world is not like sport, or chess, or other \u0026lsquo;kind\u0026rsquo; worlds. The real world varies greatly in complexity, and the era where learning a particular skill or trade is reducing in utility. A light discussion on the increasing ability to transpose strategies, patterns, and learnings from one discipline to another. And how certain training in disciplines didn\u0026rsquo;t prepare learners for varying situations, even in the same field. When less of the same is more # Learning, fast and slow # Thinking outside experience # The trouble with too much grit # Epstein goes through some case studies of West Point, ROTC, and those who join through university. Retention rates were far higher, the later the person went into the officer training system. This is in contrast with the general understanding of \u0026lsquo;passion\u0026rsquo;, which seemirgly manifests itself earlier on. Passion and grit weren\u0026rsquo;t the key drivers of success here - instead it was experience. Flirting with your possible selves # The outsider advantage # Lateral thinking with withered technology # This was a favourite chapter of mine, talking about Nintendo, and how Yoshio Sakamoto avoided the technology arms race in video game design, and leveraged old, but reliable and cheap technology in new ways to deliver entertainment to the video game market in creative ways. Reflecting on this today, Nintendo is still definitely not at the forefront of technology, but it uses technology in an almost nostalgic way to introduce fun into many people\u0026rsquo;s lives. Fooled by expertise # Learning to drop your familiar tools # We are often reluctant to drop the tools we are most familiar with, even when they are holding us back. The most extreme example of this that Epstein quoted was firefighters refusing to drop their equipment when trying to outrun forest fires or similar, resulting in them being sadly caught up in the fire. More generally, we shouldn\u0026rsquo;t always attack difficult problems with the toolsets that we are familiar with, especially in unfamiliar situations. Breadth of experience will pay off here, as well as a willingness to innovate, in trying new approaches to problems in life. Even more importantly perhaps, we shouldn\u0026rsquo;t let our tools actually hold us back, or even lead us to incorrect conclusions or worse outcomes. A quick anecdote was thrown in here about heart surgeons and usage of invasive stent surgeries as the regular, unquestioned approach, rather than \u0026lsquo;softer\u0026rsquo; methods. This actually led to poorer outcomes down the line, and the need for increased interventions later on in life. Deliberate amateurs # "},{"id":9,"href":"/book/books_superforecasting/","title":"Superforecasting , The Art \u0026 Science of Prediction","section":"Books","content":"Read in winter of 2023, borrowed from the analytical library at work (made up of books kindly donated by team members!). The authors are Philip Tetlock and Dan Gardner.\nThe entirety of the book is actually summarised pretty well in the \u0026lsquo;commandments\u0026rsquo; given at the end, which I\u0026rsquo;ve copied at the bottom.\nOverall it follows a standard pop science layout, using anecdotes and compelling narrative to bring home clear points, and I think it does a good job doing so. It touches on case studies from news, economies, and intelligence agencies (which is what I found most interesting), and also talks about the authors own experiences running forecasting tournaments. There are apparently also forecasting markets out there, which I gather are similar to betting markets (albeit I guess with more \u0026lsquo;intellectulism\u0026rsquo;). Actually, that\u0026rsquo;s a good point - at what point do you classify forecasting as betting?\nAnyways, the most valuable parts of the book I found were where the authors looked at the mannerisms and behaviours of the \u0026lsquo;superforecasters\u0026rsquo; - those who had performed well in their forecasting tournaments. And how that behaviour related (or not) to corporations and organisations around the world.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s taught me to be more careful with the language I use, and has made me think a bit more about \u0026lsquo;forecasting\u0026rsquo; in the world of energy. To what extent are we responsible for the forecasts given to us by other teams to add to our modelling assummptions? How can we add quantitative risks to these forecasts? What roles does accurate forecasting play in the political arena, where policies can be as much political as much as they are responses to percieved future events. How much can we even trust forecasts such as \u0026ldquo;We\u0026rsquo;ll have hydrogen to power by 20xx\u0026rdquo;?\nA lot of the discussion in the latter part of the book looked a lot like machine learning error classification, but applied qualitatively. That was interesting to see parallel thought processes.\nI enjoyed the book, and will probably refer back to the \u0026lsquo;commandments\u0026rsquo; listed below at some point. It\u0026rsquo;s useful as always to bring qualitative lenses into what you think are purely quantitative studies (and vice versa) to improve the quality of your decision making.\nTriage. # Focus on questions where your hard work is likely to pay off. Don’t waste time either on easy “clocklike” questions (where simple rules of thumb can get you close to the right answer) or on impenetrable “cloud-like” questions (where even fancy statistical models can’t beat the dart-throwing chimp). Concentrate on questions in the Goldilocks zone of difficulty, where effort pays off the most.\nBreak seemingly intractable problems into tractable sub-problems. # Channel the playful but disciplined spirit of Enrico Fermi who—when he wasn’t designing the world’s first atomic reactor—loved ballparking answers to head-scratchers such as “How many extraterrestrial civilizations exist in the universe?” Break apart the problem into its knowable and unknowable parts. Flush ignorance into the open. Expose and examine your assumptions. Dare to be wrong by making your best guesses. Better to discover errors quickly than to hide them behind vague verbiage.\nStrike the right balance between inside and outside views. # Superforecasters know that there is nothing new under the sun. Nothing is 100% “unique.” Language purists be damned: uniqueness is a matter of degree. So Superforecasters conduct creative searches for comparison classes even for seemingly unique events, such as the outcome of a hunt for a high-profile terrorist (Joseph Kony) or the standoff between a new socialist government in Athens and Greece’s creditors. Superforecasters are in the habit of posing the outside-view question: How often do things of this sort happen in situations of this sort?\nStrike the right balance between under- and overreacting to evidence. # Belief updating is to good forecasting as brushing and flossing are to good dental hygiene. It can be boring, occasionally uncomfortable, but it pays off in the long term. That said, don’t suppose that belief updating is always easy because it sometimes is. Skillful updating requires teasing subtle signals from noisy news flows— all the while resisting the lure of wishful thinking.\nLook for the clashing causal forces at work in each problem. # For every good policy argument, there is typically a counterargument that is at least worth acknowledging. For instance, if you are a devout dove who believes that threatening military action never brings peace, be open to the possibility that you might be wrong about Iran. And the same advice applies if you are a devout hawk who believes that soft “appeasement” policies never pay off. Each side should list, in advance, the signs that would nudge them toward the other.\nStrive to distinguish as many degrees of doubt as the problem permits but no more. # As in poker, you have an advantage if you are better than your competitors at separating 60/40 bets from 40/60—or 55/45 from 45/55. Translating vague-verbiage hunches into numeric probabilities feels unnatural at first, but it can be done. It just requires patience and practice. The Superforecasters have shown what is possible.\nStrike the right balance between under- and overconfidence, between prudence and decisiveness # Superforecasters understand the risks both of rushing to judgment and of dawdling too long near “maybe.” They routinely manage the trade-off between the need to take decisive stands (who wants to listen to a waffler?) and the need to qualify their stands (who wants to listen to a blowhard?). They realize that long-term accuracy requires getting good scores on both calibration and resolution—which requires moving beyond blame-game ping-pong. It is not enough just to avoid the most recent mistake. They have to find creative ways to tamp down both types of forecasting errors—misses and false alarms—to the degree a fickle world permits such uncontroversial improvements in accuracy.\nLook for the errors behind your mistakes but beware of rearview-mirror hindsight biases. # Don’t try to justify or excuse your failures. Own them! Conduct unflinching postmortems: Where exactly did I go wrong? And remember that although the more common error is to learn too little from failure and to overlook flaws in your basic assumptions, it is also possible to learn too much (you may have been basically on the right track but made a minor technical mistake that had big ramifications). Don’t forget to do postmortems on your successes, too. Not all successes imply that your reasoning was right. You may have just lucked out by making offsetting errors.\nBring out the best in others and let others bring out the best in you. # Master the fine art of team management, especially perspective taking (understanding the arguments of the other side so well that you can reproduce them to the other’s satisfaction), precision questioning (helping others to clarify their arguments so they are not misunderstood), and constructive confrontation (learning to disagree without being disagreeable). Wise leaders know how fine the line can be between a helpful suggestion and micromanagerial meddling or between a rigid group and a decisive one or between a scatterbrained group and an open-minded one\nMaster the error-balancing bicycle. # Implementing each commandment requires balancing opposing errors. Just as you can’t learn to ride a bicycle by reading a physics textbook, you can’t become a superforecaster by reading training manuals. Learning requires doing, with good feedback that leaves no ambiguity about whether you are succeeding—“I’m rolling along smoothly!”—or whether you are failing—“crash!” Also remember that practice is not just going through the motions of making forecasts, or casually reading the news and tossing out probabilities. Like all other known forms of expertise, superforecasting is the product of deep, deliberative practice.\nNumber 11 # And a bonus one: \u0026ldquo;Don\u0026rsquo;t treat commandments as commandments\u0026rdquo;\n"}]
