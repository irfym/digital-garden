The curriculum loosely followed Haywood and Nahmad\u0026rsquo;s structure, for the first 11 or so chapters.\nTable of contents # Definite and indefinite{: .internal-link} Noun and noun sentences{: .internal-link} Masculine and feminine{: .internal-link} Case endings{: .internal-link} Possession{: .internal-link} Plurals{: .internal-link} Verb sentences{: .internal-link} Attached pronouns{: .internal-link} Demonstrative pronouns{: .internal-link} Superlative, comparative and descriptives{: .internal-link} Definite and indefinite # ال is used to indicate the definite article in arabic. In adding the ال you drop the tanwin that you normally have at the end of an indefinite word. You can\u0026rsquo;t have them both together! Whether or not you pronounce the ل, or you join straight onto the the next letter with a shaddah depends on whether the first letter of the word is a sun or a moon letter. Nouns and noun sentences # When using adjectives to describe nouns, they have to agree on the following four elements: Definition Gender Case ending Numbers To create a complete sentence, you need something that contains complete information, and not just a fragment. [D + I = NS] Putting a definite and indefinite word together forms a complete sentence. For example: القمرُ جَميلٌ - The moon is beautiful\nQuestions can be asked by constructing the sentence in the usual way, and then placing either a هَلْ or a أ at the start of the sentence. Where the alif joins another alif, you should elide the first alif, e.g. آلقمر جميل؟. When the ل of the هَلْ joins onto ال, the first lam should take a kasrah to allow joining, e.g. هَلِ الْولد جديد.\nThere are three kinds of اسم:\nاسم جامد - these are isms which are not derived from anything, and nothing is derived from it, e.g., رَجُلٌ. اسم مصدر - these are isms which are not derived, but words can be derived from it, e.g., نَصْرٌ. اسم مشتق - these are both derived, and other words can be derived from it, e.g., عالم. Masculine and feminine # Words, اسم are split into masculine and feminine. There are three kinds of feminine words: Biologically feminine. These are words like mother, daughter, bride, etc. Feminine by design. These are words that you can make feminine, typically by adding the ta marbuta (ة). This applies mostly to adjectives, and you cannot do this to nouns - they are already inherently feminine or masculine. If there is a ة at the end of the word, you can assume 99% of the time that it is feminine. Feminine by convention. These applies to categories of words, like: Geographical names Body parts in pairs. Feminine for no apparent reason. These are ones you have to learn. Examples are شمس, ارض, نفس. Remember that the gender of the adjective has to follow the gender of the noun. Case endings # A word will have a fixed spelling, but its case ending (the vowel on the last letter) will not be fixed. This varies depending on the case of the word, and is called اِعْراب. There are three possible states for case endings: رَفْعٌ - also called the nominative state. Ending is -ُ or -ٌ نَصْبٌ - also called the accusative state. Ending is -َ or -ً جَرٌّ - also called the genitive state. Ending is -ِ or -ٍ Certain case endings are caused, and others are \u0026lsquo;default\u0026rsquo;. There are over 100 causative agents, and they all have subcategories. As an example, 17 of these agents are prepositions. Prepositions always render the following word in the j-state. For example: مِنَ البَيتِ القديمِ - from the small house\nPossession # This is known as إِضافة. There are several rules for possession: No ال on the first word. No tanwin on the first word. Kasrah on the second word (the possessor), which is the جر state. Examples are: بَيتُ الرَّخُلِ- The man\u0026rsquo;s house.\nنُورُ اللّه- The light of Allah.\nWhen adding another adjective onto the possessor, or the possessed, you need to make sure you agree with the definite/indefinite article, and the case ending. كتابُ الطالبِ الجديدِ - The new student\u0026rsquo;s book.\nكتابُ الطالبِ الجديدُ - The student\u0026rsquo;s new book.\nDespite not having a alif lam on it, the \u0026lsquo;book\u0026rsquo; above is definite, as it is known. For indefinite words, you would use -ٍ كتابُ طالبٍ - A student\u0026rsquo;s book.\nNames of places and foreign places have different case endings due to being diptotes. This means they don\u0026rsquo;t take -ِ or -ً فِ مكةَ - In Makkah\nIdhafa constructs can also be used to limit or define the application of something. هو قليل العقل - He is of little intellect.\nPlurals # Arabic plurals can take masculine or feminine, dual or plural (3+) form, and can either be broken or sound plurals. Sound plurals are typically used for adjectives, and differ between the masculine and the feminine. Their form is as follows: Masculine Feminine Single مُسْلِمٌ مُسْلِمَةٌ Dual R-state مسلمانِ مُسْلِمتانِ N/J-state مسلمَيْنِ مسلمتَيْنِ Plural R-state مسلمُونَ مسلماتٌ N/J-state مسلمِيْنَ مسلماتٍ However, most nouns will take a broken plural form, and some adjectives too. These broken plurals can appear in several different \u0026lsquo;scales\u0026rsquo;, however in practice it is probably easier just to memorise plurals along with their singular forms. Broken plurals can either be diptotes or triptotes - there is more information in Chapter 7 of Haywood and Nahmad. Broken plurals can be taken as feminine singular for the purposes of agreement. Therefore singular feminine adjectives and verbs can be used with broken masculine plurals. The exception to this is when describing male human beings, where you would use broken masculine plurals as usual (unless there\u0026rsquo;s a sound plural alternative). When you place duals in an idhafa construct, the ن at the end is dropped, e.g., كتابا الرجل (the two books of the man). Verb sentences # These follow the V-S-O format, for verb, subject, object. The subject will be in r-state, and the object is in the n-state. Sometimes the order differs, and the object may precede the verb, or the subject may precede the object. When you have explicitly specified the subject in the sentence (i.e. not used an attached pronoun), there is no need to agree the number with the subject, but you do have to agree the gender. Attached pronouns # ضَمِير - pronoun\nضَمائِر - pronouns\nPronouns can attach to three things:\nاسم فاعل حرف When attaching to an اسم, the relationship is of اضافة, e.g. كتبُكَ فالمدرسةِ (your book is in the madrasah). Pronouns are generally not declinable (i.e. مبني), except when for third-person pronouns preceded by a ي or a kasrah:\nكتابِهِ كتابِهِما كتابِهِمْ كتابِها كتابهِما كتابهِنَّ Note the small exception on the feminine singular.\nWhen attaching to a فاعل we can have both the attached object and the attached subject pronoun. One particular consideration here is when adding the attached object pronoun for انا.\nYou must place a nun wiqayah in front of the actual attached object pronoun, ي, e.g., ضربنى.\nWhen attaching to a حرف, the only type of harf that is important when adding a pronoun is the حرف جر, i.e., the preposition. This is split between the prepositions that end in a ي and those that don\u0026rsquo;t.\nFor the prepositions that don\u0026rsquo;t end in a ى, it is quite simple, you add the ضمير as usual without any further modification.\nFor those that end in a ي, you do a similar thing to the اسم above. The third person pronouns take a kasrah where possible, and for the first person, it\u0026rsquo;s فِيَّ and not فِيِّ, as the former is easier to pronounce.\nDemonstrative pronouns # These are known as اسم اِشارَة, nouns that point to something else.\nThese can be used in four ways, summarised below.\nهذا بيت - This is a house. هذا البيت - This house. هذا هو البيت - This is the house. بيت زيدٍ هذا - This house of Zayd. For \u0026rsquo;this\u0026rsquo; and \u0026rsquo;those\u0026rsquo;, see below:\nMasculine Feminine Single هذا هذه Dual R-state هذانِ هتانِ N/J-state هذينِ هتينِ Plural All states هؤُلاءِ هؤُلاءِ For \u0026rsquo;that\u0026rsquo; and \u0026rsquo;those\u0026rsquo; see below:\nMasculine Feminine Single ذالك ذاك تلك تاك تيك Dual R-state ذانِك تانِك N/J-state ذينك تينك Plural All states أُولاءِكَ أولالِكَ اُلاكَ Superlative, comparative and descriptives # All of these use the same scale: اَفْعَلُ, which is mapped to the descriptor. Superlative: Takes an idhafa construct. زيدٌ افْضَلُ الْقومِ - Zayd is the best of the people. The idhafa doesn\u0026rsquo;t depend on the gender of the person. Comparative: زيدٌ افضل من بكرٍ - Zayd is better than Bakr. Gender doesn\u0026rsquo;t matter. Descriptive: This does change by gender, as the scales differ. For masculine, the scale is اَفْعَلُ, and for feminine, the scale is فُعْلى. الرجل الأصغر - The smallest boy. البنت الصغرى - The smallest girl. Note then plurals will use the feminine singular, like you do for other adjectives. For colours, although they are on the same scale, they do not follow the same rules. It will probably just be easier for you to memorise them.

When there is a vowelled و or ي preceded by a kasrah or a dhamma, make it sakin.\nيَدْعُوُ - يَدْعُوْ\nRule 2 # Avoiding two sukuns - where you see two sukuns next to each other, you drop the first.\nأَتَيتْ - أَتَتْ\nهَدَيُوْا - هَدَاوْا - هَدَوْا\nRule 3 # Weak letters disappear at the first sign of trouble!

This one is a bit tricky, as it doesn\u0026rsquo;t always apply, so you will have to learn a lot of exceptions by heart. Best described through examples.\nقَوَلْتُ - قَالْتُ - قَلْتُ - قُلْتُ\nجَيَئْتُ - جَائْتُ - جَئْتُ - جِئْتُ\nRule 5 # The golden rule. A vowelled hamza, followed by a sakin hamza, converts the sakin hamza into a harf al-illah. The three cases are shown below.\nأَأْمَنَ - آمَنَ\nأُأْمِنَ - أُوْمِنَ\nإِأْمَانَ - إِيْمَانَ\nRule 6 # When you have a doubled letter, preceded by a sakin, the sakin moves to the first of the two doubled letters, which then in turn becomes a shaddah.\nأَدْلَلَ - أَدَلْلَ - أَدَلَّ\nأَمْدَدَ - اَمَدْدَ - أَمَدَّ\nRule 7 # Weak letters are lazy! They don\u0026rsquo;t like carrying any vowels, so where there is a vowelled و or ي preceded by a sakin, the vowels are swapped.\nأَقْوَمَ - أَقَوْمَ - أَقَامَ\nRule 8 # This is for verb template 8 only, and can be called the super ت. If the ف kalimah is an ا و ي, then change it into a ت.\nوَقَى - إِوْتَقَى - إِتْتَقَى - إِتَّقَى\nOr if there are already two ت, merge them.\nThere\u0026rsquo;s a second part of this rule, where if a ت is preceded by a د or ذ, then turn it into a the corresponding letter:\nإِذْتَكَرَ - إِذْذَكَرَ - إِذَّكَرَ\nSimilarly, if the ت is preceded by one of ط ظ ص ض then turn it into the corresponding letter:\nإِطْتَلَبَ - إِطْطَلَبَ - إِطَّلَبَ\nRule 9 # This applies when you have a و in the ف kalimah, e.g. وَجَدَ. It only applies in template 1, in the present tense. If the fa kalimah is a و, you drop it if the ع has a kasrah.\nوَجَدَ - يَوْخِدُ - يَجِدُ\nThis also applies if you have a throat letter in the ع or ل kalimah.\nوَهَبَ - يَوْهِبُ - يَهِبُ\nوَضَعَ - يَوْضَعُ - يَضَعُ\n"},{"id":3,"href":"/arabic/arabic-language/","title":"Arabic language","section":"Arabics","content":"My starting point for arabic language learning and notes:\n[[Arabic verb templates]] [[Arabic grammar, year 1]] [[Arabic regular verb conjugations]] [[Arabic irregular verb conjugations]] Useful resources:\nArabic Almanac, including Hans Wehr Haywood and Nahmad Arabic revision cheat sheet "},{"id":4,"href":"/arabic/arabic-regular-verb-conjugations/","title":"Arabic regular verb conjugations","section":"Arabics","content":" Table of contents # Perfect tense{: .internal-link} Imperfect tense{: .internal-link} Perfect tense (فعل ماضى) # Form Subject فاعل جَعَلْتُ I انا جَعَلْنا We نحن جَعَلْتَ You (m.s.) انتَ جعلتما You (m.d.) انتما جعلتم You (m.pl.) انتم جعلتِ You (f.s.) انتِ جعلتما You (f.d.) انتما جعلتنَّ You (f.pl) انتنَّ جعلَ He (s) هو جعلا They (m.d.) هما جعاوا They (m.pl.) هم جَعَلَتْ She (s) هي جَعَلَتا They (f.d.) هما جعلْنَِ They (f.pl.) هنَّ Imperfect tense (فعل مضارع) # Form Subject فاعل أَفْعَلُ I انا نَفْعَلُ We نحن تَفْعَلُ You (m.s.) انتَ تَفْعَلانِ You (m.d.) انتما تَفْعَلونَ You (m.pl.) انتم تَفْعَلينَ You (f.s.) انتِ تَفْعَلانِ You (f.d.) انتما تَفْعَلْنَ You (f.pl) انتنَّ يَفْعَلُ He (s) هو يَفْعَلانِ They (m.d.) هما يَفْعَلونَ They (m.pl.) هم تَفْعَلُ She (s) هي تَفْعَلانِ They (f.d.) هما تَفْعَلْنَ They (f.pl.) هنَّ The present tense is also called the imperfect tense.

These letters can change the standard conjugations of the verbs. Common verbs with \u0026lsquo;weak\u0026rsquo; letters are below:\nاَخَذَ - he took سَأَلَ - he asked وَجَدَ - he found قَالَ - he said جَاءَ - he arrived/he came (a great thing) دَعَا - he called هَدَا - he guided وَقَى - he saved اَتَى - he arrived/came (a small thing) كَانَ - he was وَلِيَ - he was near, he was close, he was in charge These rules for conjugating verbs with weak letters apply to all templates, not just template 1.\nTemplate 2 # Template 2 has a shaddah on the ع kalimah. Moving from template 1 to 2, changes the meaning from intransitive to transitive (include the arabic for these terms when you get the chance). For example, نَزَلَ (he revealed), to نَزَّلَ (he sent it down), where an object is now needed.\nCommon verbs in template 2:\nعَلَّمَ - he taught يَسَّرَ - he made it easy حَوَّلَ - he converted (it) سَمَّيَ - he named (it) كَلَّمَ - he spoke to فَصَّلَ - he made it clear Template 3 # The extra letter here is an ا after the ف kalimah. Template 3 often involves a meaning change from template 1, where there is an exchange between two or more people. For example, قَرُبَ (he was near), to قَارَبَ (he came close, he came near).\nCommon verbs in template 3:\nقَارَبَ - he came close آخَذَ - he blamed/reproached تَابَعَ - he followed (each other) غَافَرَ - he forgave (mutually) نَادى - he summoned Template 4 # Template 4 is one of the most common templates found in the Qur\u0026rsquo;an. It\u0026rsquo;s also very distinct as the only verb template with a همزةالقطع, as opposed to a همزة الوصل. This involves a \u0026lsquo;stop\u0026rsquo; on pronouncing the hamza at the start, which is not skipped in joining.\nCommon verbs in template 4:\nأَكْرَمَ - he ennobled اَجْرَجَ - he removed/evicted اَنْزَلَ - he revealed أَرْسَلَ - he transmitted آمَنَ - he believed أَدَلَّ - he was conceited أَؤْجَدَ - he obtained/produced/evoked أرَادَ - he wanted/intended أَقَامَ - he established أَعْطى - he provided أَضَلَّ - he misled This template contains command verbs, but not always. It is also a template that contains a range of meaning patterns, whether they be transitive, intransitive, causative, stative, etc.\nTemplate 5 # This template, along with template 6, is known as the template of fathas, due to the vowelling of the active past, and both present forms. The extra letters are the ت before the ف kalimah, and the shaddah on the ع kalimah. This template is reflexive of template 2 (which is the intransitive version of template 1). Thus عَلَّمَ (he taught) becomes تَعَلَّمَ (he learned), i.e. to teach yourself.\nCommon verbs on template 2:\nتَعَلَّمَ - he learned تَوَلَّى - he took charge تَقَرَّبَ - he came close/approached Template 6 # Along with template 5, this is another باب of fathas. The extra letters here are a ت before the ف kalimah, and an ا after the ع kalimah.\nThe meaning pattern implies a mutual application of action, and is reflexive of template 3.\nCommon verbs in template 6:\nتَقَارَبَ - he approached each other Template 7 # This is a passive verb form, like the 6th form of template 1. The extra letters at the إِنْ before the ف kalimah.\nCommon verbs in template 7:\nإِنْفَطَرَ - he broke into tears Template 8 # The meaning pattern of this template is normally reflexive of template 1. For example, وَقَى (he saved) to إِتَّقََى (he was aware, he was on guard, protect one\u0026rsquo;s self). The extra letters here are the إِ before the ف kalimah and the ت after the ف kalimah.\nTemplate 9 # This template is typically only used for colours and physical disabilities. The extra letters are the إِ before the ف kalimah and the shaddah on the ل kalimah.\nExample verbs:\nاِحْمَرَّ - he turned red When conjugating this verb, you would open up the double letter (as it occurs at the end) - for example اِحْمَرَرْتُ. More technically, it\u0026rsquo;s only in the third person conjugations that rule 6 applies and the final two letters are doubled.\nTemplate 10 # This template is known for its است before the ف kalimah (which means to seek). It is reflexive of template 1 or 4, seeking the action of quality of the verb it is reflexive upon. Note that the passive form is not really used, like in many other cases, where the passive construction is theoretical but not practically used.\nExample verbs:\nإِسْتَغْفَرَ - he sought forgiveness "}]
