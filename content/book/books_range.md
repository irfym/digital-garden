title: Range, Why Generalists Triumph in a Specialized World

Some thoughts and lessons from the book [Range: Why Generalists Triumph in a Specialized World](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/41795733-range), which I read in January 2021. The writing style was very engaging - you can see clearly where Epstein's sports writing experience has come in here, and was highly enjoyable to read. Each chapter laid out a strong, clear concept, backed up by either research, anecdotes, biographies, or similar.

I wanted to note down the key takeaways from the book, for future reference.

## The cult of the head start

- Tiger woods vs Roger Federer, the latter having a much more varied sports upbringing. But both achieved the top in their respective fields.
- However, the real world is not like sport.

## How the wicked world was made

- Discussion on how the real world is not like sport, or chess, or other 'kind' worlds. The real world varies greatly in complexity, and the era where learning a particular skill or trade is reducing in utility.
- A light discussion on the increasing ability to transpose strategies, patterns, and learnings from one discipline to another. And how certain training in disciplines didn't prepare learners for varying situations, even in the same field.

## When less of the same is more

## Learning, fast and slow

## Thinking outside experience

## The trouble with too much grit

- Epstein goes through some case studies of West Point, ROTC, and those who join through university. Retention rates were far higher, the later the person went into the officer training system. This is in contrast with the general understanding of 'passion', which seemirgly manifests itself earlier on. Passion and grit weren't the key drivers of success here - instead it was experience.

## Flirting with your possible selves


## The outsider advantage

## Lateral thinking with withered technology

- This was a favourite chapter of mine, talking about Nintendo, and how Yoshio Sakamoto avoided the technology arms race in video game design, and leveraged old, but reliable and cheap technology in new ways to deliver entertainment to the video game market in creative ways. Reflecting on this today, Nintendo is still definitely not at the forefront of technology, but it uses technology in an almost nostalgic way to introduce fun into many people's lives.

## Fooled by expertise

## Learning to drop your familiar tools

- We are often reluctant to drop the tools we are most familiar with, even when they are holding us back. The most extreme example of this that Epstein quoted was firefighters refusing to drop their equipment when trying to outrun forest fires or similar, resulting in them being sadly caught up in the fire.
- More generally, we shouldn't always attack difficult problems with the toolsets that we are familiar with, especially in unfamiliar situations. Breadth of experience will pay off here, as well as a willingness to innovate, in trying new approaches to problems in life.
 - Even more importantly perhaps, we shouldn't let our tools actually hold us back, or even lead us to incorrect conclusions or worse outcomes. A quick anecdote was thrown in here about heart surgeons and usage of invasive stent surgeries as the regular, unquestioned approach, rather than 'softer' methods. This actually led to poorer outcomes down the line, and the need for increased interventions later on in life.                 

## Deliberate amateurs
