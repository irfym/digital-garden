## Definite and indefinite <a name="definite"></a>

- ال is used to indicate the definite article in arabic. In adding the ال you drop the tanwin that you normally have at the end of an indefinite word. You can't have them both together!
- Whether or not you pronounce the ل, or you join straight onto the the next letter with a shaddah depends on whether the first letter of the word is a sun or a moon letter.

## Nouns and noun sentences <a name="noun_sentences"></a>

- When using adjectives to describe nouns, they have to agree on the following four elements:
  1. Definition
  2. Gender
  3. Case ending
  4. Numbers
- To create a complete sentence, you need something that contains complete information, and not just a fragment.
- [D + I = NS] Putting a definite and indefinite word together forms a complete sentence. For example:

 القمرُ جَميلٌ - The moon is beautiful

- Questions can be asked by constructing the sentence in the usual way, and then placing either a هَلْ or a أ at the start of the sentence. Where the alif joins another alif, you should elide the first alif, e.g. آلقمر جميل؟. When the ل of the هَلْ joins onto ال, the first lam should take a kasrah to allow joining, e.g. هَلِ الْولد جديد.

- There are three kinds of اسم:
  - اسم جامد - these are isms which are not derived from anything, and nothing is derived from it, e.g., رَجُلٌ.
  - اسم مصدر - these are isms which are not derived, but words can be derived from it, e.g., نَصْرٌ.
  - اسم مشتق - these are both derived, and other words can be derived from it, e.g., عالم.

## Masculine and feminine <a name="masculine"></a>

- Words, اسم are split into masculine and feminine. There are three kinds of feminine words:
  1. Biologically feminine. These are words like mother, daughter, bride, etc.
  2. Feminine by design. These are words that you can make feminine, typically by adding  the ta marbuta (ة). This applies mostly to adjectives, and you cannot do this to nouns - they are already inherently feminine or masculine. If there is a ة at the end of the word, you can assume 99% of the time that it is feminine.
  3. Feminine by convention. These applies to categories of words, like:
    * Geographical names
    * Body parts in pairs.
  4. Feminine for no apparent reason. These are ones you have to learn. Examples are شمس, ارض, نفس.
- Remember that the gender of the adjective has to follow the gender of the noun.

## Case endings <a name="case_endings"></a>

- A word will have a fixed spelling, but its case ending (the vowel on the last letter) will not be fixed. This varies depending on the case of the word, and is called اِعْراب.
- There are three possible states for case endings:
  1. رَفْعٌ - also called the nominative state. Ending is -ُ or -ٌ
  2. نَصْبٌ - also called the accusative state. Ending is -َ or -ً
  3. جَرٌّ - also called the genitive state. Ending is -ِ or -ٍ
- Certain case endings are caused, and others are 'default'.
- There are over 100 causative agents, and they all have subcategories. As an example, 17 of these agents are prepositions.
- Prepositions always render the following word in the j-state. For example:

 مِنَ البَيتِ القديمِ - from the small house

## Possession <a name="possession"></a>

- This is known as إِضافة.
- There are several rules for possession:
  1. No ال on the first word.
  2. No tanwin on the first word.
  3. Kasrah on the second word (the possessor), which is the جر state.
- Examples are:

 بَيتُ الرَّخُلِ- The man's house.\
 نُورُ اللّه- The light of Allah.

- When adding another adjective onto the possessor, or the possessed, you need to make sure you agree with the definite/indefinite article, and the case ending.

كتابُ الطالبِ الجديدِ - The new student's book.\
كتابُ الطالبِ الجديدُ - The student's new book.

- Despite not having a alif lam on it, the 'book' above is definite, as it is known.
- For indefinite words, you would use -ٍ

 كتابُ طالبٍ - A student's book.

- Names of places and foreign places have different case endings due to being diptotes.
- This means they don't take -ِ or -ً

 فِ مكةَ - In Makkah

 - Idhafa constructs can also be used to limit or define the application of something.

 هو قليل العقل - He is of little intellect.

## Plurals <a name="plurals"></a>

- Arabic plurals can take masculine or feminine, dual or plural (3+) form, and can either be broken or sound plurals.
- Sound plurals are typically used for adjectives, and differ between the masculine and the feminine. Their form is as follows:

|        |           | Masculine | Feminine |
|--------|-----------|-----------|----------|
| Single |           | مُسْلِمٌ      | مُسْلِمَةٌ    |
| Dual   | R-state   | مسلمانِ    | مُسْلِمتانِ  |
|        | N/J-state | مسلمَيْنِ    | مسلمتَيْنِ  |
| Plural | R-state   | مسلمُونَ    | مسلماتٌ   |
|        | N/J-state | مسلمِيْنَ    | مسلماتٍ   |

- However, most nouns will take a broken plural form, and some adjectives too.
- These broken plurals can appear in several different 'scales', however in practice it is probably easier just to memorise plurals along with their singular forms.
  - Broken plurals can either be diptotes or triptotes - there is more information in Chapter 7 of Haywood and Nahmad.
- Broken plurals can be taken as feminine singular for the purposes of agreement. Therefore singular feminine adjectives and verbs can be used with broken masculine plurals.
  - The exception to this is when describing male human beings, where you would use broken masculine plurals as usual (unless there's a sound plural alternative).
- When you place duals in an idhafa construct, the ن at the end is dropped, e.g., كتابا الرجل (the two books of the man).

## Verb sentences <a name="verb_sentences"></a>

- These follow the V-S-O format, for verb, subject, object.
- The subject will be in r-state, and the object is in the n-state.
- Sometimes the order differs, and the object may precede the verb, or the subject may precede the object.
- When you have explicitly specified the subject in the sentence (i.e. not used an attached pronoun), there is no need to agree the number with the subject, but you do have to agree the gender.

## Attached pronouns <a name="attached_pronouns">

- ضَمِير - pronoun
- ضَمائِر - pronouns

- Pronouns can attach to three things:
  1. اسم
  2. فاعل
  3. حرف

- When attaching to an اسم, the relationship is of اضافة, e.g. كتبُكَ فالمدرسةِ (your book is in the madrasah). Pronouns are generally not declinable (i.e. مبني), except when for third-person pronouns preceded by a ي or a kasrah:
  - كتابِهِ
  - كتابِهِما
  - كتابِهِمْ
  - كتابِها
  - كتابهِما
  - كتابهِنَّ
- Note the small exception on the feminine singular.

- When attaching to a فاعل we can have both the attached object and the attached subject pronoun. One particular consideration here is when adding the attached object pronoun for انا.
- You must place a nun wiqayah in front of the actual attached object pronoun, ي, e.g., ضربنى.

- When attaching to a حرف, the only type of harf that is important when adding a pronoun is the حرف جر, i.e., the preposition. This is split between the prepositions that end in a ي and those that don't.
- For the prepositions that don't end in a ى, it is quite simple, you add the ضمير as usual without any further modification.
- For those that end in a ي, you do a similar thing to the اسم above. The third person pronouns take a kasrah where possible, and for the first person, it's فِيَّ and not فِيِّ, as the former is easier to pronounce.

## Demonstrative pronouns <a name="demonstrative_pronouns">

- These are known as اسم اِشارَة, nouns that point to something else.
- These can be used in four ways, summarised below.
  - هذا بيت - This is a house.
  - هذا البيت - This house.
  - هذا هو البيت - This is the house.
  - بيت زيدٍ هذا - This house of Zayd.

- For 'this' and 'those', see below:

  |        |           | Masculine | Feminine |
  |--------|-----------|-----------|----------|
  | Single |           |هذا|هذه|
  | Dual   | R-state   |هذانِ|هتانِ|
  |        | N/J-state | هذينِ|هتينِ|
  | Plural | All states| هؤُلاءِ|هؤُلاءِ|

- For 'that' and 'those' see below:

  |        |           | Masculine | Feminine |
  |--------|-----------|-----------|----------|
  | Single |           |ذالك ذاك|تلك تاك تيك|
  | Dual   | R-state   |ذانِك|تانِك|
  |        | N/J-state |ذينك|تينك|
  | Plural | All states|أُولاءِكَ أولالِكَ اُلاكَ|


## Superlative, comparative and descriptives <a name="superlatives">

- All of these use the same scale: اَفْعَلُ, which is mapped to the descriptor.
- Superlative:
  - Takes an idhafa construct.
  - زيدٌ افْضَلُ الْقومِ - Zayd is the best of the people.
  - The idhafa doesn't depend on the gender of the person.
- Comparative:
  - زيدٌ افضل من بكرٍ - Zayd is better than Bakr.
  - Gender doesn't matter.
- Descriptive:
  - This does change by gender, as the scales differ. For masculine, the scale is اَفْعَلُ, and for feminine, the scale is فُعْلى.
  - الرجل الأصغر - The smallest boy.
  - البنت الصغرى - The smallest girl.
  - Note then plurals will use the feminine singular, like you do for other adjectives.
- For colours, although they are on the same scale, they do not follow the same rules.
- It will probably just be easier for you to memorise them.
