## Conjugation rules

These rules describe 'post-justified' rules, in that they have been created to best *explain* the irregular conjugations as found in the arabic language. They are *not* the rules that these irregular verb forms are conjugated in accordance to, and therefore may not always work.

### Rule 1

Whenever you see a vowelled weak letter, preceded by a fathah, you turn the weak letter into an alif.

قَوَلَ - قَالَ\
هَدَيَ - هَدَا

There is a part 2 of this rule, which applies only in the present tense (and not all the time). When there is a vowelled و or ي preceded by a kasrah or a dhamma, make it sakin.

يَدْعُوُ - يَدْعُوْ

### Rule 2

Avoiding two sukuns - where you see two sukuns next to each other, you drop the first.

أَتَيتْ - أَتَتْ\
هَدَيُوْا - هَدَاوْا - هَدَوْا

### Rule 3

Weak letters disappear at the first sign of trouble! If there is a sakin alif before a dual feminine, and preceded by a fathah, then drop it.

هَدَيَتَا - هَدَاتَا - هَدَتَا\
أَتَيَتَا - أَتَاتَا - أَتَتَا


### Rule 4

Distinguishing dhamma and kasrah. This one is a bit tricky, as it doesn't always apply, so you will have to learn a lot of exceptions by heart. Best described through examples.

قَوَلْتُ - قَالْتُ - قَلْتُ - قُلْتُ\
جَيَئْتُ - جَائْتُ - جَئْتُ - جِئْتُ

### Rule 5

The golden rule. A vowelled hamza, followed by a sakin hamza, converts the sakin hamza into a harf al-illah. The three cases are shown below.

أَأْمَنَ - آمَنَ\
أُأْمِنَ - أُوْمِنَ\
إِأْمَانَ - إِيْمَانَ

### Rule 6

When you have a doubled letter, preceded by a sakin, the sakin moves to the first of the two doubled letters, which then in turn becomes a shaddah.

أَدْلَلَ - أَدَلْلَ - أَدَلَّ\
أَمْدَدَ - اَمَدْدَ - أَمَدَّ

### Rule 7

Weak letters are lazy! They don't like carrying any vowels, so where there is a vowelled و or ي preceded by a sakin, the vowels are swapped.

أَقْوَمَ - أَقَوْمَ - أَقَامَ

### Rule 8

This is for verb template 8 only, and can be called the super ت. If the ف kalimah is an ا و ي, then change it into a ت.

وَقَى - إِوْتَقَى - إِتْتَقَى - إِتَّقَى

Or if there are already two ت, merge them.

There's a second part of this rule, where if a ت is preceded by a د or ذ, then turn it into a the corresponding letter:

إِذْتَكَرَ - إِذْذَكَرَ - إِذَّكَرَ

Similarly, if the ت is preceded by one of ط ظ ص ض then turn it into the corresponding letter:

إِطْتَلَبَ - إِطْطَلَبَ - إِطَّلَبَ

### Rule 9

This applies when you have a و in the ف kalimah, e.g. وَجَدَ. It only applies in template 1, in the present tense. If the fa kalimah is a و, you drop it if the ع has a kasrah.

وَجَدَ - يَوْخِدُ - يَجِدُ

This also applies if you have a throat letter in the ع or ل kalimah.

وَهَبَ - يَوْهِبُ - يَهِبُ\
وَضَعَ - يَوْضَعُ - يَضَعُ
