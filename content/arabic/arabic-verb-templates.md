title: Arabic verb templates
---

A short overview of the different verb templates covered in my arabic classes (excluding verb templates 11 and above, as they're not so common).  Aside from the below, [this](https://corpus.quran.com/documentation/verbforms.jsp) looks like a good summary of the different verb forms, and covers more possible meaning patterns than are in my notes below.

## Template 1 <a name="template_1"></a>

Template 1 can be found in 6 forms:

| Form | Past, present  (active)  | Notes |
|----------|----------------------------:|
| I | خَعَلَ , يَجْعَلُ | Throat letters on the ع kalimah *always* take this form |
| II | نَزَلَ , يَنْزِلُ |  |
| III | كَفَرَ , يَكْفُرُ |  |
| IV  | سَمِعَ , يَسْمَعُ |  |
| V | حَسِبَ , يَحْسِبُ |  |
| VI | كَرُمَ , يَكْرُمُ | Often used for characteristics. Has a passive meaning pattern |

Common verbs in Template 1:

- خَعَلَ (a), he made, put
- نَزَلَ (i), he descended
- كَفَرَ (u), he disbelieved
- سَمِعَ (a), he heard
- حَسِبَ (i), he considered
- كَرُمَ, he was noble
- قَرُبَ, he was near
- ظَلَمَ (i), he did wrong, he oppressed
- غَفَرَ (i), he forgave
- خَلَقَ (u), he created
- خَرَجَ (u), he exited
- عَمِلَ (a), he did, worked, acted

There are also a number common template 1 verbs, which contain 'weak' letters (و ء ي). These letters can change the standard conjugations of the verbs. Common verbs with 'weak' letters are below:

- اَخَذَ - he took
- سَأَلَ - he asked
- وَجَدَ - he found
- قَالَ - he said
- جَاءَ - he arrived/he came (a great thing)
- دَعَا - he called
- هَدَا - he guided
- وَقَى - he saved
- اَتَى - he arrived/came (a small thing)
- كَانَ - he was
- وَلِيَ - he was near, he was close, he was in charge

These rules for conjugating verbs with weak letters apply to *all* templates, not just template 1.

## Template 2 <a name="template_2"></a>

Template 2 has a shaddah on the ع kalimah. Moving from template 1 to 2, changes the meaning from intransitive to transitive (include the arabic for these terms when you get the chance). For example, نَزَلَ (he revealed), to نَزَّلَ (he sent it down), where an *object* is now needed.

Common verbs in template 2:

- عَلَّمَ - he taught
- يَسَّرَ - he made it easy
- حَوَّلَ - he converted (it)
- سَمَّيَ - he named (it)
- كَلَّمَ - he spoke to
- فَصَّلَ - he made it clear

## Template 3 <a name="template_3"></a>

The extra letter here is an ا after the ف kalimah. Template 3 often involves a meaning change from template 1, where there is an exchange between two or more people. For example, قَرُبَ (he was near), to قَارَبَ (he came close, he came near).

Common verbs in template 3:
 - قَارَبَ - he came close
 - آخَذَ - he blamed/reproached
 - تَابَعَ - he followed (each other)
 - غَافَرَ - he forgave (mutually)
 - نَادى - he summoned

## Template 4 <a name="template_4"></a>

Template 4 is one of the most common templates found in the Qur'an. It's also very distinct as the only verb template with a همزةالقطع, as opposed to a همزة الوصل. This involves a 'stop' on pronouncing the hamza at the start, which is not skipped in joining.

Common verbs in template 4:
- أَكْرَمَ - he ennobled
- اَجْرَجَ - he removed/evicted
- اَنْزَلَ - he revealed
- أَرْسَلَ - he transmitted
- آمَنَ - he believed
- أَدَلَّ - he was conceited
- أَؤْجَدَ - he obtained/produced/evoked
- أرَادَ - he wanted/intended
- أَقَامَ - he established
- أَعْطى - he provided
- أَضَلَّ - he misled

This template contains command verbs, but not always. It is also a template that contains a range of meaning patterns, whether they be transitive, intransitive, causative, stative, etc.

## Template 5 <a name="template_5"></a>

This template, along with template 6, is known as the template of fathas, due to the vowelling of the active past, and both present forms. The extra letters are the ت before the ف kalimah, and the shaddah on the ع kalimah. This template is reflexive of template 2 (which is the intransitive version of template 1). Thus عَلَّمَ (he taught) becomes تَعَلَّمَ (he learned), i.e. to teach yourself.

Common verbs on template 2:
- تَعَلَّمَ - he learned
- تَوَلَّى - he took charge
- تَقَرَّبَ - he came close/approached

## Template 6 <a name="template_6"></a>

Along with template 5, this is another باب of fathas. The extra letters here are a ت before the ف kalimah, and an ا after the ع kalimah.

The meaning pattern implies a mutual application of action, and is reflexive of template 3.

Common verbs in template 6:
- تَقَارَبَ - he approached each other

## Template 7 <a name="template_7"></a>

This is a passive verb form, like the 6th form of template 1. The extra letters at the إِنْ before the ف kalimah.

Common verbs in template 7:
- إِنْفَطَرَ - he broke into tears

## Template 8 <a name="template_8"></a>

The meaning pattern of this template is normally reflexive of template 1. For example, وَقَى (he saved) to إِتَّقََى (he was aware, he was on guard, protect one's self). The extra letters here are the إِ before the ف kalimah and the ت after the ف kalimah.

## Template 9 <a name="template_9"></a>

This template is typically only used for colours and physical disabilities. The extra letters are the إِ before the ف kalimah and the shaddah on the ل kalimah.

Example verbs:
- اِحْمَرَّ - he turned red

When conjugating this verb, you would open up the double letter (as it occurs at the end) - for example اِحْمَرَرْتُ. More technically, it's only in the third person conjugations that rule 6 applies and the final two letters are doubled.

## Template 10 <a name="template_10"></a>

This template is known for its است before the ف kalimah (which means to seek). It is reflexive of template 1 or 4, seeking the action of quality of the verb it is reflexive upon. Note that the passive form is not really used, like in many other cases, where the passive construction is theoretical but not practically used.

Example verbs:
- إِسْتَغْفَرَ - he sought forgiveness
